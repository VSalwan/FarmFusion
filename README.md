# Soil Quality Assessment and Crop Prediction System

## Overview

The **Soil Quality Assessment and Crop Prediction System** is an innovative project designed to help farmers make informed decisions about crop selection and fertilizer usage based on various environmental parameters. By leveraging real-time data from sensors measuring temperature, humidity, soil type, and other factors, this system predicts the best crops suitable for cultivation under given conditions. Additionally, it integrates an e-commerce platform for farmers to purchase recommended fertilizers conveniently.

## Features

- **Crop Prediction**: Utilizes input parameters from sensors to predict the most suitable crops for the given conditions.
- **Fertilizer Recommendations**: Suggests specific fertilizers that enhance crop growth based on soil quality and environmental factors.
- **E-commerce Integration**: Provides a marketplace for farmers to purchase the recommended fertilizers directly from the application.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate interface for farmers to input data and receive predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL for storing crop data, fertilizer information, and user details
- **IoT Sensors**: Temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil type sensors
- **APIs**: For e-commerce functionalities and third-party services


## Usage
-Input Parameters: Enter the readings from the sensors such as temperature, humidity, soil type, etc
-Get Predictions: Click on the 'Submit' button to receive crop recommendations and fertilizer suggestions.
-Purchase Fertilizers: Navigate to the e-commerce section to select and buy the recommended fertilizers.
